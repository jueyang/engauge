This bill, the “Disaster  Information Access Act,” requires certain providers of electric, natural gas,  and water service (provider) to report service interruptions that occur in  connection with a major catastrophic event to the State Office of Emergency  Management (office), mayors or other municipal chief executives, as  appropriate, governing bodies of affected municipalities, and county  freeholders of affected counties. “Major catastrophic event” is defined in the  bill to mean a natural or humanly caused occurrence arising from conditions  beyond the control of the provider, including, but not limited to, a terrorist  attack, thunderstorm, tornado, hurricane, flood, heat wave, snowstorm or ice  storm, or an earthquake, which results in: (1) a sustained interruption of  service to at least 10 percent of the customers in an operating area or 10 percent of the customers of  a municipality or county located in an operating area; or (2) the  declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor or by the President.   
Under the bill, the provider  is to, within 24 hours of a major catastrophic event, report information  pertaining to service interruptions occurring in connection with the event  within the provider’s operating area to the office and, upon request, to the  mayor (or chief executive, depending upon the form of government) and governing  body of each affected municipality, and to the governing body of each affected  county. The report is to include the following information: (1) the cause of  the interruption; (2) the estimated time of resumption of service; and (3) any  health and safety advisories, including boil water advisories. The provider is  to, within 24 hours of a major catastrophic event, provide to the office, a  report which is to include information in connection with the provider’s work  to restore interrupted service, including plans for ongoing work in each  affected municipality, and factors which may hinder or delay restoration of  service.   
Within 24 hours after  submission of the initial report, a provider is to issue to the office, and  upon request, to the mayor, and the governing body of each affected municipality  and county, a report that includes information in connection with: (1) the provider’s  work to restore interrupted service, including plans for ongoing work in the affected  municipalities or counties; and (2) factors which may hinder or delay  restoration of service.   
In addition, the bill directs  that, upon submission of each report, a provider shall relay the information  contained in the report, and any other information the provider deems  appropriate, through posting on its website, and by audio message on a 24-hour  toll-free telephone service maintained by the provider. A provider is also  required to provide daily updates to the mayor and governing body of each affected  municipality and county of any new information as it pertains to that  municipality or county.   
The bill requires the New  Jersey Department of Transportation, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the  South Jersey Transportation Authority, and any other State or local entity  having jurisdiction over any road or highway to report to the office any known  road or highway closures resulting from a major catastrophic event involving a  declaration of emergency.   
The bill directs the office to  post on its website, and communicate on a telephone service line established by  the office, within 24 hours of receipt, the information reported to the office  pursuant to the bill. The office is required to list the information by county  and municipality and take appropriate steps to publicize the telephone service  and availability of information on its website.   
Any provider who fails to  report interruption related information pursuant to the bill would be liable  for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day that the violation  continues and, in the case of investor-owned electric, gas, and water public  utilities, civil penalties shall not be recoverable from ratepayers.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A3000/2989_I1.HTM
ASSEMBLY, No. 3344 ---   
Clarifies that county sheriff may simultaneously hold  position of emergency management coordinator.     ---Assemblywoman ALISON LITTELL MCHOSE

---District 24---   
This bill clarifies that a  county sheriff may simultaneously hold the position of emergency management  coordinator under certain circumstances. Current law permits a county sheriff  to simultaneously hold the office of “county disaster control coordinator” provided  the sheriff does not receive additional compensation or benefits for holding  that office.    
Most statutory references to  “disaster control coordinator” were updated to the current phrase “emergency  management coordinator” in amendments made to the law in 1989. The reference to  “disaster control coordinator” under N.J.S.40A:9-108 is the only remaining  statutory reference to that title. This bill revises the terminology under  current law to reflect the updated title, “emergency management coordinator,”  and bring N.J.S.40A:9-108 in conformity with current statutory law.               ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A3500/3344_I1.HTM
ASSEMBLY, No. 3545 ---   
Establishes program certifying certain broadcast  station personnel to undertake certain actions during emergencies.    ---Assemblywoman ANNETTE QUIJANO

---District 20---   
This bill, entitled the “First  Informer Broadcasters Act,” provides that, consistent with federal and State  laws, rules, and regulations, the State Office of Emergency Management (OEM) in  the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety, in  consultation with a Statewide organization that represents broadcasters, is to  develop and oversee a program, to be administered by a Statewide organization  that represents broadcasters, for training and certifying a broadcaster as a  first informer broadcaster. The program is to include, but not be limited to:   
(1) training and education  concerning restoring, repairing, and resupplying any facilities and equipment  of a broadcaster in an area affected by an emergency;    
(2) training and education  concerning the personal safety of a first informer broadcaster in an area affected  by an emergency; and   
(3) certification issued by  the State Office of Emergency Management to broadcasters that have completed  first informer broadcaster training.   
To the extent practicable and  consistent with public safety and recovery efforts, State and local  governmental agencies are to allow a first informer broadcaster access to an  area affected by an emergency for the purpose of restoring, repairing, or  resupplying any facility or equipment necessary to acquire, produce, and  transmit to the public essential emergency-related alerts or programming,  including, but not limited to, transporting fuel to alternative emergency power  generators.   
A record of first informer  broadcaster certification is to be provided to and remain on file with the  State OEM and is to be made available to State and local government agencies.   
Under the bill, “broadcaster”  means senior station management or other technical or senior personnel employed  by a broadcasting business or an independent contractor that contracts with a  broadcasting business.   
“Broadcasting business” means  a full-power radio broadcasting station, a cable television company, or a  television broadcast station, and who conducts business in this State.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A4000/3545_I1.HTM

Waterfront walkways within  busy metropolitan areas create unique dangers to the public. Emergency call  boxes that allow a person to immediately and directly contact law enforcement  or emergency medical services can help to address this safety issue.    
This bill requires every  municipality with a population density of over 15,000 persons per square mile  to install emergency call boxes along any waterfront walkway that is open to  the public, and that directly abuts a major waterway such as the Hudson River. Municipalities subject to the requirement shall complete an installation every  eighth of a mile along each public waterfront walkway.    
In order to pay for emergency  call box installation and maintenance, the Director of the State Office of  Emergency Management (director) shall award grants to municipalities subject to  the call box requirements. Subject municipalities may incur indebtedness and  borrow money in anticipation of such grant awards. Grant awards shall be  funded through a surcharge of up to $5 to be paid to the director, collected  out of each fine from traffic control signal monitoring systems, better known  as red light cameras. The director shall determine the amount of each surcharge  to be paid, up to $5, depending on the amount necessary to carry out all  installation and maintenance requirements, and may alter such payment amounts  as necessary. If the maximum $5 per fine payments are insufficient to fulfill installation  and maintenance requirements, then, as necessary, the director may scale back  such installation placement requirements, and may restrict a municipality’s  ability to incur indebtedness and borrow money in anticipation of grant  payments.   
This bill takes effect  immediately upon enactment, but the call box installation and funding  provisions would remain inoperative until the first day of the sixth month next  following enactment, by which point the director shall adopt necessary rules  and regulations. Municipalities subject to this bill’s requirements shall have  until the first day of the thirteenth month next following this operative date  to comply with all emergency call box installation and maintenance  requirements.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A4000/3571_I1.HTM

This bill, known as “The Reliability,  Preparedness, and Storm Response Act,” requires the Board of Public Utilities  (“BPU”) to develop and enforce performance benchmarks for service reliability  and communications for electric public utilities and requires electric public  utilities to submit to the BPU a review of strategies to mitigate flooding of  substations within flood zones.   
In addition, the bill requires  all public utilities conducting business in the State to file a service  reliability plan and an emergency communications strategic plan for review and  approval by the BPU. After review of a public utility’s service reliability or  communications plan, the BPU may order the public utility to make such  modifications as it deems reasonably necessary to remedy any deficiency.   
The BPU will have the  authority to open an investigation to review the performance or communications  of a public utility during an outage in the public utility’s service area. If  the BPU finds that, as a result of the failure of a public utility to implement  its service reliability plan or communications plan, the public utility’s  performance was materially less effective, the BPU may impose a civil  administrative penalty.   
This bill amends existing law  to increase the civil penalties paid by all public utilities for lapses in  service delivery, preparedness, and responsiveness in emergencies. Civil  penalties will be increased from $100 a day to $25,000 for each violation, but  penalties are not to exceed $2,000,000 for any series of related events. The “Board  of Public Utilities Civil Penalty Fund” will be established in the BPU, into  which all penalties collected will be deposited. The money in the fund will be  used to increase public utilities’ service quality and reliability. Civil  penalties will not be recoverable from ratepayers.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/166_I1.HTM

This bill temporarily waives  the requirement that fuel merchants obtain a distributor’s license to import or  deliver motor fuel from another state into this State when the Governor  declares a state of energy emergency.   
Under current law, fuel  merchants cannot purchase motor fuel from another State and import or deliver  it in New Jersey unless the merchant first obtains a distributor’s license.  Due to fuel shortages following Hurricane Sandy, this licensing provision was  temporarily waived by the Governor to allow merchants to purchase fuel from  across State lines and boost supplies for New Jersey motorists. Under this  bill, the distributor’s license requirement would be automatically suspended  when a state of energy emergency is declared, allowing merchants to import fuel  from out-of-State as soon as possible following the declaration.   
The bill suspends the  distributor’s license requirement to import or deliver motor fuel from another  state into this State for a period of 10 days following the declaration of a  state of energy emergency or such period as determined by the Governor by  executive order. Any person who is not a licensed distributor that imports or  delivers fuel from another state pursuant to the bill’s provisions must  document any out-of-State fuel purchases and pay any State taxes required  pursuant to applicable law.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/313_I1.HTM

This bill makes it a crime of  the fourth degree for a public servant, during a state of emergency, to  knowingly use or make disposition of a public resource in an unauthorized  manner with purpose to obtain a benefit for himself or another.   
The term “state of emergency”  is defined as a natural or man-made disaster or emergency for which a state of  emergency has been declared by the President of the United States or the  Governor, or for which a state of emergency has been declared by a municipal  emergency management coordinator.   
The bill also specifies that  conviction of the crime established by the bill would constitute an offense  involving or touching the public servant’s office, position, or employment for  the purposes of N.J.S.2C:51-2. Under that statute, a person holding any public  office, position or employment, elective or appointive, must forfeit the  office, position or employment if he is convicted of “an offense involving or  touching such office, position or employment.” In addition, such person is also  barred from any future public employment.   
In addition, the bill  specifies that it would not preclude or limit the prosecution or conviction of  a public servant for any other offense. The sponsor notes that other offenses  may also be applicable when a public servant uses a public resource for an  unauthorized purpose, including but not limited to corruption of public  resources pursuant to P.L.2007, c.158 (C.2C:27-12); theft pursuant to  N.J.S.2C:20-3; and official misconduct pursuant to N.J.S.2C:30-2. This bill is  intended to create an additional tool for prosecutors in these situations.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/363_I1.HTM

This bill authorizes the New  Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (“commission”) to issue South Jersey Vietnam  Veterans’ Association license plates for a motor vehicle owned or leased and  registered in this State.   
The bill requires a $50  application fee and a $10 annual renewal fee for these license plates, in  addition to the fees otherwise prescribed by law for the registration of a  motor vehicle.   
The additional fees would be  deposited in the &quot;South Jersey Vietnam Veterans’ Association License Plate  Fund&quot; (&quot;fund&quot;), in the Department of the Treasury, created in  this bill. The funds would be appropriated equally on an annual basis to the  Department of Military and Veterans Affairs for the aid of veterans  organizations and to the Emergency Management Section of the New Jersey State  Police for use by local emergency management organizations.   
The commission would be  reimbursed for the costs incurred for producing, issuing, renewing, and  publicizing the availability of the special plates from donors and the fees  collected prior to their deposit into the fund. The Chief Administrator of the  New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (&quot;chief administrator&quot;) is to  annually certify the average cost per license plate incurred in the immediately  preceding year which cost is to be certified by the Joint Budget Oversight  Committee, or its successor. If the certified average cost per license plate  exceeds the $50 application fee for two consecutive years, the chief  administrator may discontinue issuing the South Jersey Vietnam Veterans’  Association license plate.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/467_I1.HTM

Ensures operation of certain motor fuel storage,  distribution and dispensing facilities during disasters and emergencies.     ---Senator JAMES W. HOLZAPFEL

---District 10---   
This bill provides for a  number of measures designed to assure the operation of certain motor fuel  storage, distribution and dispensing facilities during disasters and  emergencies.   
Specifically, the bill  requires that no later than December 31, 2006, each motor fuel terminal  facility and wholesaler that sells motor fuel in this State shall be capable,  in the event of a disaster, of operating its motor fuel distribution loading  racks using an alternate generated power source for a minimum of 72 hours. The  bill further requires that each newly constructed or substantially renovated gasoline  station for which a certificate of occupancy is issued on or after September 1,  2006, and all gasoline stations having eight or more fueling positions that are  within five miles of an interstate highway or a State or federally-designated  evacuation route by no later than December 31, 2006, are to be pre-wired with  an appropriate transfer switch, and be capable of operating all fuel pumps,  dispensing equipment, life-safety systems, and payment acceptance equipment  using an alternate generated power source.   
The bill establishes the  &quot;New Jersey Disaster Motor Fuel Supplier Program&quot; (“program”) within  the Department of Law and Public Safety. The program is to allow any motor  fuel retail dealer doing business in this State to participate in a network of  emergency responders to provide motor fuel supplies and services at their  gasoline stations to government, medical, critical infrastructure, and other  emergency responders, as well as the general public, during a declared state of  emergency. Participation in the program would require a pre-certification of  preparedness of the retail dealer by the State Office of Emergency Management  (“OEM”) to provide emergency motor fuel supplies and services. The Director of  the State OEM is to establish requirements for such pre-certification by no  later than September 1, 2006. No retail dealer is to be pre-certified unless  that retail dealer has the on-site capability to provide motor fuel dispensing  services to emergency responders, demonstrates the ability to have such service  available within 24 hours after a declared state of emergency, and agrees to  make such service available as needed.   
The bill provides that during  a declared state of emergency, emergency response personnel who can produce  appropriate identification, as determined by State or county emergency  management officials, are to be given priority for motor fuel purchases at  gasoline stations operated by retail dealers that are certified under the  program. Such certified gasoline stations may be directed by county or state  emergency management officials to remain open for a period during a declared  curfew to provide service for emergency personnel. Under such direction, such  certified gasoline stations are not to be deemed in violation of the curfew and  are not to be penalized for such operation, nor shall the emergency personnel  be in violation of such curfew. Retail dealers that are pre-certified may  request the Director of the State OEM for priority re-supply fueling in order  to continue service to emergency responders.   
The bill provides to a retail  dealer participating in the program a tax credit in an amount equal to 25  percent of the cost of the purchase and installation during the taxable year of  the transfer switch and alternate generated power source required to meet the  certification requirements established by the State OEM. The total tax credit  to be given to a retail dealer is not to exceed $15,000.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/496_I1.HTM

This bill would allow eligible  volunteer firefighters and first aid and rescue squad members to take an  additional $500 personal exemption as a deduction from gross income under the New Jersey gross income tax beginning in tax year 2003.   
The bill specifically sets  forth eligibility requirements for persons who want to claim the additional  personal exemption. Fire company members would be eligible if they serve as a  volunteer for the entire tax year, respond to at least 60% of regular alarms  and 60% of drills, and have attained the rank of Firefighter I Certified. First  aid and rescue squad members would be eligible if they serve as a volunteer for  the entire tax year, respond to at least 10% of regular alarms and 60% of the  drills, and have passed an approved training program or qualified as an  emergency medical technician.   
The official in charge of each  fire department or force or first aid or rescue squad is required to submit  annually to the appropriate State agency a list of members who have met the  above requirements.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S1000/634_I1.HTM

SENATE, No. 978 ---   
Exempts certain aspects of out-of-State business  operations from certain tax, fee, registration, and licensing requirements  during performance of in-State declared disaster or emergency related work.     ---Senator NICHOLAS P. SCUTARI

---District 22---   
This bill exempts certain aspects  of out-of-State business operations from certain tax, fee, registration, and  licensing requirements during performance of in-State declared disaster or  emergency related work. The purpose of this bill is to remove tax, fee, registration  and licensing requirements as impediments to the rapid deployment of  out-of-State workers in response to a declared disaster or emergency so as to facilitate  the expedient restoration of certain critical infrastructure and utilities.   
The bill exempts out-of-State  businesses that conduct operations within this State for purposes of performing  declared disaster or emergency related work during a disaster period from complying  with otherwise applicable State and local business registration, licensing,  tax, and fees implicated as a result of that work. The bill’s exemption  extends to out-of-State employees’ income tax reporting and related withholding  obligations, as well as other State and local tax obligations.   
The bill’s exemption does not  cover taxes imposed on transactions tied to in-State consumption. The bill  specifies that out-of-State businesses and employees remain liable for fuel  taxes, sales and use taxes, hotel and motel occupancy taxes and fees, and motor  vehicle rental taxes and fees.    
The bill’s tax and business  registration exemptions cease to apply 60 days after the declared disaster or  emergency period starts. This means that if an out-of-State business or employee  remains in-State after the 60-day-period then it is subject to the State’s  normal standards for taxes, fees, licensing, and registration.   
Bill also restricts its  exemptions to those explicitly provided and denotes that the bill may not be  construed to relieve damages on account of negligence.   
The bill allows the President  of the Board of Public Utilities to request a written statement, from each  out-of-State business that enters this State to provide disaster or emergency  related work. The bill requires the statement to include notice that the  out-of-State business is in-State for purposes of disaster or emergency related  work, tax identification information, and contact information. The bill also  allows the President of the Board of Public Utilities to request the same  written statement from a business registered to do business in the State for  each out-of-State business affiliate that enters this State for purposes of  responding to the declared disaster or emergency.    
The bill authorizes the  Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and the  President of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities to adopt rules and  regulations to effectuate the bill, including emergency rulemaking authority for  the first 360 days following the date of enactment.   
The bill is scheduled to take  effect on the date of enactment.               ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S1000/978_I1.HTM
SENATE, No. 1102 ---   
Adds members representing fire fighting and fire  safety interests to the Domestic Security Preparedness Planning Group.    ---Senator ANTHONY R. BUCCO

---District 25---   
This bill would add three  additional members to the Domestic Security Preparedness Planning Group. The  new members would include the Director of the Division of Fire Safety in the  Department of Community Affairs, a representative of the New Jersey Career Fire  Chiefs Association, and a representative of the New Jersey Deputy Fire Chiefs  Association. These additional members would enhance the representation of fire  fighting and fire safety interests on the Domestic Security Preparedness  Planning Group.   
The planning group was  established in 2001 as part of the &quot;New Jersey Domestic Security  Preparedness Act,&quot; P.L.2001, c.246 (C.App.A:9-64 et seq.). The planning  group was given responsibility for assisting the Domestic Security Preparedness  Task Force in the performance of the task force's duties. The planning group  is specifically responsible for developing a coordinated plan, for  consideration by the task force, concerning the State's preparation for,  response to, and recovery from incidents of terrorism. This plan, once  reviewed and approved by the task force, is incorporated into the State  Emergency Operations Plan.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S1500/1102_I1.HTM

This bill requires each  municipality to establish a Reverse 9-1-1 system within 18 months of the bill's effective date. These systems permit municipalities and law enforcement  agencies to forward a pre-recorded message to residents and businesses within a  designated geographical area. Reverse 9-1-1 systems are commonly used to notify residents of an emergency in their area, such as a fire, flood or prison  escape.   
Funding for the Reverse 9-1-1 systems would be provided through a $2 surcharge to traffic offenses to be deposited  in the &quot;Reverse 9-1-1 Systems Fund.&quot; The fund is created in the  Office of Emergency Telecommunications in the Office of Information and  Technology. Monies in the fund are to be used exclusively for grants to  municipalities for the expenses of establishing and maintaining Reverse 9-1-1 systems.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S2000/1516_I1.HTM

The bill provides for the  licensure of pediatric respite care facilities in this State. The bill defines  “pediatric respite care facility” to mean a facility licensed by the DOH that provides home-like care in a  facility for two weeks or less of respite care, or as necessary for end-of-life  care or as medically necessary for children up to age 21 with limited life expectancies or  complex, life-limiting illnesses and support for their families, and employs an  interdisciplinary team to assist in providing curative treatment when possible,  palliative care, and supportive services to meet the physical, emotional,  spiritual, social, and economic needs of children and their families during  illness, as well as during dying and bereavement if no cure is attained.   
A licensed  pediatric long-term care facility would be considered a pediatric respite care  facility under the bill, but would not be subject to any of the bill’s  requirements.   
The  bill authorizes the Commissioner of Health to establish by regulation the standards for operation of these  facilities and the requirements of applicants seeking  licensure to operate them. In addition to any other requirements set forth by  the Commissioner of Health, an applicant shall be required to provide criminal  history record background checks of each staff member and facility  administrator, payment of reasonable fees for the issuance or renewal of  licenses, and documentation of compliance with standards and policies  established by the commissioner regarding: the core services to be provided;  professional personnel requirements; standards of patient care; and  administration of the facility.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A1500/1028_I1.HTM

This bill stipulates that a  health care professional who places, or causes to be placed, an advertisement  for that health care professional’s services shall include in that  advertisement the health care professional's name, and the full name of the  professional's State-granted license type, except that physicians licensed to  practice medicine and surgery may use the abbreviation &quot;MD&quot; or  &quot;DO&quot; to describe their license.   
The bill stipulates that a  health care professional who provides information regarding health care  services on an Internet website that is directly controlled or administered by  the health care professional, or that health care professional's office  personnel, shall prominently display on that Internet website the health care  professional's name, and the full name of the professional's State-granted  license type, except that physicians licensed to practice medicine and surgery  may use the abbreviation &quot;MD&quot; or &quot;DO&quot; to describe their  license.   
Additionally, under the bill,  a health care professional who includes the phrase &quot;board certified&quot;  in an advertisement, may only advertise such certification provided that the  full name of the certifying board or association and the full name of the  specialty or sub-specialty is included, and the certifying board or association  is:   
(1) An American Board of  Medical Specialties, an American Osteopathic Association (AOA), or American  Podiatric Medical Association certifying board; or   
(2) A board or association  approved by the State Board of Medical Examiners, which requires:   
(a) successful completion of  a post-graduate residency program approved by the Accreditation Council for  Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or AOA that provides complete training in  the specialty or subspecialty certified; and   
(b) prior certification by  the member board of the American Board of Medical Specialties or AOA that  examines residents completing that ACGME or AOA approved program for that  residency.   
The bill clarifies that  nothing in the bill requires an employer of health care professionals to  identify the name, State-granted professional license type, and highest level  of academic degree of employed health care professionals in advertisements that  do not identify those employees.   
The bill also provides that a  health care professional who knowingly places, or caused to be placed, an  advertisement for health care services that is intentionally misleading or  deceptive is guilty of a disorderly persons offense. A disorderly persons  offense is punishable by up to 6 months imprisonment and up to a $1,000 fine.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A1500/1031_I1.HTM

This bill provides a supplemental  appropriation of $3.963 million from the General Fund to the Department of  Education for nonpublic nursing services aid. When combined with the funding  included in the Appropriations Act as enacted, the State would provide $90 per  pupil for nonpublic nursing services.   
The supplemental appropriation  would increase the per pupil funding to a level approximately consistent with  the provisions of N.J.S.18A:43-31. Under this section of law, the per pupil  aid amount was set at $61.44 for the 1997-1998 school year, and was to be  increased by the CPI in each subsequent year. However, the amount appropriated  in the 2011-2012 school year only provides $65.56 per pupil for nonpublic  nursing services aid. This represents a 6.7 percent increase in per pupil funding.  In contrast, the CPI has increased by nearly 42 percent during the same  timeframe.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A1500/1068_I1.HTM

This bill requires the  Commissioner of Health and Senior Services, in consultation with the  Commissioner of Human Services, to establish a training program for nursing  home staff (certified nurse aides, licensed practical nurses, registered  professional nurses, and other health care professionals who provide direct  care to nursing home residents) in the care of residents who have behavioral  health issues.   
The training program would  include, but not be limited to: sensitivity to behavioral health issues among  residents of nursing homes; information about depression and other psychiatric  disorders, as appropriate; and the use of medication to treat those disorders.  The bill requires nursing homes to provide the training annually.   
The bill has a delayed  effective date of the first day of the seventh month following enactment, but  allows the Commissioners of Health and Senior Services and Human Services to  take anticipatory administrative action as necessary to implement the bill.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A1500/1081_I1.HTM

Revises procedure for transfer of terminated  employees of closed local health agency to superseding local health agency.     ---Assemblyman JACK M. CIATTARELLI

---District 16---   
This bill provides that, in  the case of a local health agency whose activities and responsibilities are  assumed by a superseding local health agency, such as a county health agency, an  employee of the local health agency may be transferred to the superseding local  agency, and be assigned duties comparable to those previously performed by him.  The transferred employee would be subject to layoff procedures prior to the  transfer to the new entity. Once transferred, the employee would be subject to  any employment contracts and provisions that exist for the new entity. The  final decision of which employees shall transfer to the new employer would be  vested solely with the local unit that would provide the service.   
The bill also provides that in  the event that the superseding local health department to which certain  employees may be transferred is subject to the provisions of the Civil Service  law, the Civil Service Commission shall vest only those transferred employees  who have been employed for two years or more in permanent status, pursuant to  N.J.S.11A:9-9, in appropriate titles, seniority, and tenure with the providing  local unit based on the duties of the position.   
Under current law, when the  activities and responsibilities of a local health agency are assumed by a  superseding local health agency, all terminated employees of the old agency  must be transferred to the new agency, at the same position and salary and with  the same rights and privileges, which minimizes the possibility of any cost  savings.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A1500/1156_I1.HTM

This bill establishes the  Nursing Student Support Program in the Higher Education Student Assistance  Authority (HESAA).   
This program would provide  loan forgiveness of a portion of eligible loans from the Federal Family  Education Loan Program (FFELP) and the College Loans to Assist State Students  Loan Program (NJCLASS) that are borrowed by eligible participants, for each  year of approved full-time employment as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) or  registered professional nurse (RN) in New Jersey after completing a nursing  education program. The program would become operational in the 2006-2007  academic year.   
Eligible participants would  include, but not be limited to, a certified nurse aide, personal care assistant  or homemaker-home health aide who seeks to become a LPN or RN, a LPN who seeks  to become a RN, a RN who graduated from a two-year degree program or a hospital  school of nursing and seeks to obtain a bachelor's degree in nursing, as well  as a person not currently engaged in nursing and seeking to become a LPN or RN.   
To be eligible to participate  in the program, an applicant would be required to:   
-- be a State resident and  maintain domicile in the State while participating in the program;   
-- be enrolled in an approved  course of study;   
-- maintain a grade point  average of at least 3.0 on a scale of 4.0, or its equivalent, in an approved  course of study; and   
-- enter into a written  contract with the authority to become employed in this State as a LPN or RN, as  applicable, no later than one year after completing an approved course of  study. A nursing graduate would be required to be employed as a LPN or RN, as  applicable, for a period of one year for each year that the graduate is provided  with loan redemption under the program.   
The program may provide loan  forgiveness to eligible participants as follows:    --In the case of a  four-year institution of higher education or hospital school of nursing, the  loan forgiveness may be for up to $10,000 for each year of approved  employment. The maximum loan forgiveness amount would not exceed $40,000 for a  four-year program and $30,000 for a hospital school of nursing.    --In the case of a  two-year program, the loan forgiveness may be for up to $4,000 for each year of  approved employment. The maximum loan forgiveness amount would not exceed  $8,000.    --In the case of a  LPN program at a county vocational school, the loan forgiveness may be for up  to $3,000 for each year of approved employment. The maximum loan forgiveness  amount would not exceed $3,000.   
Finally, the bill requires the  executive director of the HESAA to annually report to the Governor and the  Legislature on the Nursing Student Support Program.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A1500/1233_I1.HTM

ASSEMBLY, No. 1431 ---   
Requires State Board of Education regulations  regarding school nurse certification to include certain minimum eligibility  requirements.     ---Assemblywoman MARLENE CARIDE

---District 27---   
State Board of Education  regulations at N.J.A.C.6A:9-13.3 and 13.4 govern school nurse certification.  The State board recently adopted amendments to these provisions, which reduced  credit requirements for a school nurse endorsement from 30 to 21 semester hour  credits, and reduced credit requirements for a non-instructional school nurse  endorsement from 21 to 15 semester hour credits. The amendments also  eliminated the requirement that a candidate for a school nurse endorsement  complete a minimum of 6 credits in a college-supervised school nurse practicum,  half of which is completed in a school nurse office and the balance of which is  completed in a classroom.   
This bill codifies the  previous requirements at N.J.A.C.6A:9-13.3 that a candidate for a school nurse  endorsement must complete a minimum of 30 semester hour credits that includes  study in subject areas determined by the State board and clinical experience in  a school nurse office, in addition to holding a license as a registered nurse  and a bachelor’s degree. The bill also codifies the previous requirement that  a candidate for a school nurse endorsement must complete a college-supervised  school nurse practicum experience in a school nurse office and a classroom.  With regard to non-instructional school nurses, the bill codifies the previous  requirements at N.J.A.C.6A:9-13.4 that a candidate for a non-instructional  school nurse endorsement must complete a minimum of 21 credits that includes  study in subject areas determined by the State board and clinical experience in  a school nurse office, in addition to holding a license as a registered nurse  and a bachelor’s degree.   
The bill provides minimum  requirements for school nurse certification and does not limit the authority of  the State board to prescribe additional eligibility requirements for a school  nurse endorsement or a school nurse/non-instructional endorsement.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A1500/1431_I1.HTM

This bill would create  “Prescriptions for Parks,” which would allow practitioners to write a  prescription for a New Jersey State Park Pass for patients diagnosed with  obesity-related conditions – such as diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, and  heart disease – which may be treated with exercise. This program would be  similar to others implemented around the country in Indiana, New York, New Mexico,  California, and Chicago.   
The special pass would be  valid for free entrance and parking to all 50 New Jersey State Park  facilities. A prescription would be good for two 12-week sessions or 24 weeks  and would have to be renewed every 12 weeks or otherwise the patient would be  required to pay the regular entrance and parking fees.   
The Division of Parks and  Forestry in the Department of Environmental Protection would develop a brochure  for suggested workouts within park facilities, utilizing already established  activity programs and trails. The Division of Parks and Forestry would also  provide informational materials concerning the Park Prescription Program to the  Department of Health for dissemination to the medical community.   
By linking the medical  community with public parks, New Jersey residents will be encouraged to hike,  walk, jog, swim, and kayak in nature – all while improving their health. The  Division of Parks and Forestry would develop a brochure for suggested workouts  within park facilities, utilizing already-established activity programs and  trails.   
According to the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of adult Americans are  considered obese and at risk for heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Obesity  has been linked with numerous health conditions including high blood pressure,  coronary disease, asthma, sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders, cancer,  liver disease, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, mental health conditions,  and diabetes.   
Numerous studies have  associated increased physical activity with improved health and lower health  care expenses. At least 10 percent of the nation’s health care costs are  caused by obesity. Sedentary individuals who increased their physical activity  to at least three days a week saved an average of $2,200 in health care charges  per year. Furthermore, people with access to parks are 50 percent more likely  to maintain a walking regimen.   
Public lands are an  underutilized resource and by incentivizing New Jersey residents to exercise  and visit State parks – citizens will be healthier, insurance companies will  shoulder less of a burden, health care tax dollars saved, and the State’s  beautiful parks will be highlighted and enjoyed.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2000/1569_I1.HTM

---District 35---   
This bill increases penalties  against practitioners for improper prescribing.   
“Practitioner” is defined in  the bill as a person who is licensed, registered, or otherwise authorized to  practice as a health care professional pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised  Statutes, and is authorized by State law to prescribe in the course of that  person’s professional practice.   
“Improper prescribing” is  defined as the prescribing of a drug in an indiscriminate manner, or not in  good faith, or without good cause, or otherwise in violation of any State or  federal law or regulation, and which constitutes professional misconduct as  determined by the applicable licensing board. For the purposes of this bill,  the issuance of an initial such prescription or order and any refill of that  initial prescription or order will each be counted as a separate instance of  “improper prescribing” or an “improper prescription.”   
The bill provides that,  notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary and in addition  to any other penalty provided by law, a practitioner who engages in improper  prescribing is subject to the following action by the applicable licensing  board:   
-- if the number of improper  prescriptions does not exceed 10, a suspension of that individual’s license or  other authorization to practice for a period not to exceed six months, at the  conclusion of which period the practitioner may apply to the board for  reinstatement of the individual’s license or other authorization to practice;   
-- if the number of improper  prescriptions is more than 10 but does not exceed 50, a suspension of that  individual’s license or other authorization to practice for a period not to  exceed one year, at the conclusion of which period the practitioner may apply  to the board for reinstatement of the individual’s license or other  authorization to practice;   
-- if the number of improper  prescriptions is more than 50 but does not exceed 100, a suspension of that  individual’s license or other authorization to practice for a period not to  exceed five years, at the conclusion of which period the practitioner may apply  to the board for reinstatement of the individual’s license or other  authorization to practice; and   
-- if the number of improper  prescriptions is more than 100, a permanent revocation of that individual’s  license or other authorization to practice.   
In addition, or as an  alternative, to a disciplinary action by the applicable board pursuant to this  bill, a practitioner who engages in improper prescribing is liable to a civil  penalty as follows:   
-- if the number of improper  prescriptions does not exceed 10, a penalty not to exceed $50,000;   
-- if the number of improper  prescriptions is more than 10 but does not exceed 50, a penalty not to exceed  $100,000;   
-- if the number of improper  prescriptions is more than 50 but does not exceed 100, a penalty not to exceed  $250,000; and   
-- if the number of improper prescriptions  is more than 100, a penalty not to exceed $500,000.    
A civil penalty imposed  pursuant to the bill is to be collected by summary proceeding, under the “Penalty  Enforcement Law of 1999,” in a civil action brought by the Attorney General.   
The bill takes effect on the  first day of the third month following enactment.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2000/1743_I1.HTM

ASSEMBLY, No. 1824 ---   
Requires suicide prevention continuing education  courses for physicians and podiatrists.     ---Assemblywoman PAMELA R. LAMPITT

---District 6---   
This bill requires each person  licensed as a physician, as a condition for biennial registration, to complete  10 hours of continuing education credits in suicide prevention. Currently, the  State Board of Medical Examiners requires each physician to complete 100  credits of continuing medical education, all of which shall be in Category I or  Category II as a condition for biennial registration. This bill would not  increase the total number of credits required, but would require 10 of the 100  credits be related to suicide prevention courses.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2000/1824_I1.HTM

This bill provides for various  revisions to the laws governing lawsuits and insurance coverage for medical  malpractice.   
The bill provides specifically  as follows:    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  A malpractice action against a health care provider is to be  commenced within two years after the plaintiff or patient discovers, or through  the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the injury, but not more  than four years after the date of the alleged act, omission, neglect or  occurrence that is the basis of the action, except that in the case in which  the allegation of malpractice against the health care provider is that a  foreign object has been wrongfully left within a patient’s body, the claim is  to be barred unless commenced within one year after the plaintiff or patient  discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,  the existence of the foreign object wrongfully left in the patient’s body,  whichever first occurs.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  An action by or on behalf of a minor that has accrued for medical  malpractice for injuries sustained at birth is to be commenced prior to the  minor’s 11th birthday (rather than the minor’s 13th birthday, as currently  provided in the law).    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  The bill revises the requirements for an affidavit by an  appropriately licensed person to be provided by a plaintiff in certain  negligence and malpractice actions, by further requiring that the affidavit  state that the care, skill or knowledge used in the treatment, practice or work  that is the subject of the complaint did not meet a commonly recognized  reasonable standard of care. In the case of an action for medical malpractice,  the affidavit is to further: (1) establish that there was a provider-patient  relationship and identify the specific act by the defendant which is the basis  for the cause of action against the defendant, or, if there was no  provider-patient relationship, identify the specific act by the defendant which  is the basis for the cause of action against the defendant; and (2) be based on  and refer to objective scientific clinical evidence. The person executing the  affidavit is to include in the affidavit a certification, under penalty of  perjury, that the patient’s chart and other pertinent information submitted has  been personally reviewed. A person is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree  (punishable by imprisonment for up to 18 months or a fine of up to $10,000, or  both) if the person purposefully or knowingly makes, or causes to be made, a  false, fictitious, fraudulent, or misleading statement of material fact in, or  omits a material fact from, or causes a material fact to be omitted from, any such  affidavit.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  A court may waive the same specialty or subspecialty recognized  by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American Osteopathic  Association and board certification requirements of section 7 of P.L.2004, c.17  (C.2A:53A-41), upon motion by the party seeking a waiver, if, after the moving  party has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that a good faith  effort has been made to identify an expert in the same specialty or  subspecialty, and the court has been presented with the reasons for any person  declining to give expert testimony or execute an affidavit in the case, the  court determines that the expert possesses sufficient training, experience, and  knowledge to provide the testimony as a result of active involvement in, or  full-time teaching of, medicine in the applicable area of practice or a related  field of medicine during the year immediately preceding the date of the  occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action. The good faith  requirement for a waiver by the court pursuant to this paragraph will not be  met by a showing that reviewing or potentially reviewing experts declined to  give testimony or execute an affidavit based upon a lack of merit.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  In an action alleging medical malpractice, a person is not to  give expert testimony or execute an affidavit pursuant to the provisions of  P.L.1995, c.139 (C.2A:53A-26 et seq.) on the appropriate standard of practice  or care unless the person is licensed as a physician or other health care  professional in New Jersey, as opposed to the current requirement that the  physician or professional be licensed in the United States, provided however,  that a court may waive the requirement that a person providing testimony as an  expert witness be licensed in New Jersey upon sufficient evidence that no  person licensed in New Jersey meets the qualifications set forth in section 7  of P.L.2004, c.17 (2A:53A-41).    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  Expert testimony in an action alleging medical malpractice is to  be based on and refer to objective scientific clinical evidence, as defined in  the bill. A person testifying as an expert witness in such an action is guilty  of a crime of the fourth degree and is permanently barred from presenting  expert testimony in this State if the person purposefully or knowingly makes,  or causes to be made, a false, fictitious, fraudulent, or misleading statement  of material fact in, or omits a material fact from, or causes a material fact  to be omitted from, any expert testimony.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  An insurer is prohibited from increasing the premium of any  medical malpractice liability insurance policy based on a claim of medical  negligence or malpractice against an insured:   
-- unless the claim, as  defined in the bill, results in a medical  malpractice claim settlement,  judgment or arbitration award  against the insured; or   
-- if the alleged medical  malpractice occurred in any case in which  the insured performed any  treatment or procedure on a charitable  basis, without consideration; or in  which the insured provided  emergency assistance pursuant to section 10 of  P.L.2004, c.17 (C.2A:62A-1.3), whether or not for consideration.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  In any judgment resulting from a medical malpractice action  brought by a claimant for medical malpractice, if agreed to by the parties, the  court may approve payment of a judgment or settlement in the form of a  structured payment agreement by any person, organization, group, or insurer  that is contractually liable to pay the judgment. (This modifies the structured  settlement provision of the current law, which: applies only to medical  malpractice actions in which noneconomic damages exceed $1 million; and  requires that 50% of those damages be paid immediately, including the costs and  attorney's fees, and the remainder within 60 months.)    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  Every claim or demand filed against an insured for damages in  excess of $100,000 per occurrence for economic loss and non-economic loss is to  document the economic loss for which relief is sought and to set forth in  detail the economic loss incurred at the time the case is subject to a  complementary dispute resolution proceeding, at the time settlement  negotiations are entered into, or at the time a case is tried, as well as a  detailed statement of claimed prospective economic loss resulting from the  allegation of medical malpractice, which documentation is to be updated from  time to time as necessary and be provided to the court, the complementary  dispute resolution agent, or (in the case of settlement) the defendant, as  applicable.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  In every trial in which damages are awarded in an action alleging  medical malpractice, the trier of fact is to separately itemize damages awarded  for economic loss and damages awarded for non-economic loss; and the judge  presiding over the proceeding is to review each verdict to determine, pursuant  to section 9 of P.L.2004, c.17 (C.2A:53A-42), whether the award is clearly  inadequate, excessive, or disproportionate in view of the nature of the medical  condition or injury that is the cause of action or because of passion or  prejudice by the jury.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is to be presumed that a person who signs an informed consent  form or document for a medical procedure or other form of health care has read  that form or document.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  If an attorney representing a plaintiff in a medical malpractice  action files the complaint using fictitious names for one or more persons who  may be determined to be parties to the action but whose role is unknown at the  time of the filing of the complaint, there is to be no time limitation within  which the attorney may substitute the name of any person or persons for a  fictitious name nor any other bar to such substitution if the person or persons  are subsequently determined to be joined as a party to the action.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  A physician licensed to practice medicine in this State will not  be liable for civil damages as a result of any act or omission in connection  with the rendering of any treatment or procedure for illness or injury if the  treatment or procedure is rendered while the physician is performing the  treatment or procedure as a volunteer, in good faith and without consideration,  at a clinic, other health care facility, or any other location where the  treatment or procedure is being rendered.    ·&nbsp;  The bill takes effect immediately and applies to actions for  damages that accrue on or after the effective date of the bill.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2000/1918_I1.HTM
ASSEMBLY, No. 1921 ---    &nbsp;    ---Assemblyman HERB CONAWAY, JR.

---District 18---   
This bill tightens the  standards and requirements for expert witnesses in actions involving medical  malpractice and amends N.J.S.A.2A:53A-41, which sets forth the standards for  expert witnesses.   
The bill makes the following  changes to the expert witness requirements:   
the bill deletes the option that an expert  witness for a specialist or subspecialist would be qualified to give testimony  if the person is either a hospital-credentialed physician or a board certified  specialist or subspecialist in the same specialty or subspecialty and requires,  instead, that the person be both hospital-credentialed and board certified;   
the bill deletes the option that an expert  witness for a specialist or subspecialist would be qualified to give testimony  if the person devotes a majority of his professional time to the instruction of  students in an accredited medical school, other accredited health professional  school or accredited residency or clinical research program in the same health  care profession in which the defendant is licensed and requires, instead, that  the person devote a majority of his professional time to the active clinical  practice of the same health care profession in which the defendant is licensed;  and   
regarding the court's option to waive the same  specialty or subspecialty requirement for an expert witness, the bill provides  that the waiver shall be granted if the court determines that:   
(1) the  expert specializes in a substantially similar speciality or subspecialty that  includes the evaluation, diagnosis or treatment of the medical condition that  is the subject of the claim or action and has prior clinical experience  treating similar patients;   
(2) if the  party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is board  certified in a speciality or subspecialty, the expert is certified by a board  recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties or the American  Osteopathic Association in a specialty or subspecialty having acknowledged expertise  and training directly related to the particular health care matter at issue;   
(3) the  expert has devoted a majority of his professional time during the five years  immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the  claim or action to the active clinical practice of the same or a substantially  similar specialty or subspecialty recognized by the American Board of Medical  Specialties or the American Osteopathic Association; and   
(4) the  expert has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court both that the  standards of care and practice in the two specialties or subspecialties are  similar and that the expert has substantial familiarity between the specialties  or subspecialties.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2000/1921_I1.HTM
ASSEMBLY, No. 1924 ---   
Extends Medical Malpractice Liability Insurance  Premium Assistance Fund and collection of annual surcharges for 5 years.     ---Assemblyman HERB CONAWAY, JR.

---District 35---    &nbsp;   
This bill extends for a  five-year period, and reestablishes the collection of revenue for, the Medical  Malpractice Liability Insurance Premium Assistance Fund, which was established  pursuant to section 27 of P.L.2004, c.17 (C.17:30D-29), and which expired three  years after the effective date of that law.    
The bill provides specifically  as follows:    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of the monies in the fund, $17 million is to be allocated  annually to provide medical malpractice liability insurance premium subsidies  to health care providers who, as a class of providers, are most severely  impacted by high premium rates.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  In addition, monies from the fund are to be allocated annually,  for various health care purposes, in the following manner:   
-- $6.9 million to the Health  Care Subsidy Fund, established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1992, c.160  (C.26:2H-18.58), for charity care subsidies to hospitals;    
-- $1 million to a program  within the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority to provide student  loan expense reimbursement for obstetrician/gynecologists who agree to practice  in State designated underserved areas as established pursuant to section 1 of  P.L.1999, c.46 (C.18A:71C-35) (which program was originally established under  section 29 of P.L.2004, c.17 (C.18A:71C-49), expired three years after the  effective date of that law, and is reestablished under section 3 of this bill);  and   
(b) $1.2 million to the Primary  Care Physician and Dentist Loan Redemption Program established pursuant to N.J.S.18A:71C-33.      ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fund is to be comprised of revenue from: an annual surcharge  of $3 per employee for all employers who are subject to the New Jersey  “unemployment compensation law”; and an annual charge of $75 for all practicing  physicians, podiatrists, chiropractors, dentists, optometrists, and attorneys  licensed in this State.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance is to present an annual  report to the Governor and the Legislature that provides detailed information  on the operation of the fund and the expenditure of monies from the fund as  provided for in the bill.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  The bill repeals section 29 of P.L.2004, c.17 (C.18A:71C-49),  concerning the student loan expense reimbursement program established pursuant  thereto, which expired three years after the effective date of P.L.2004, c.17,  and the provisions of which are reenacted by this bill.    ·&nbsp;&nbsp;  The bill also repeals section 30 of P.L.2004, c.17 (C.30:4J-7),  concerning coverage under the NJ FamilyCare Program for certain pregnant women  whose income is up to 100% of the federal poverty level, because the provisions  of that section have been obviated by the increase in eligibility for Medicaid  under P.L.2005, c.156 (C.30:4J-8 et seq.), to cover parents and children whose  income is up to 133% of the federal poverty level.     ·&nbsp;  The bill takes effect on the 30th day after enactment.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2000/1924_I1.HTM

Requires construction of new buildings, facilities,  and structures using State, EDA, or NJ Schools Development Authority funds to  include green or blue roofs.    ---Assemblyman WAYNE P. DEANGELO

This bill would require any  new building, facility, or structure, the construction of which is funded in  whole or in part by the State, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority,  or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, to be designed, constructed,  and managed to include a functioning green roof or blue roof. All plans,  specifications and bid proposal documents for any building, facility, or  structure to which the bill applies would be required to identify the design  standards to be used for the green roof or blue roof and the requirements for  its maintenance.

These retired officers would  work during hours when the public school is normally in session or when it is  occupied by public school students or their teachers.   
Under the bill, these retired  law enforcement officers would be accorded full police powers while on the  school premises or within 100 feet of the school as long as they retired within  five years of being hired by the board and they comply with requirements set  forth authorizing retired law enforcement officers to carry handguns, including  qualifying in the use of a handgun twice a year.   
A retired law enforcement  officer employed would be required to wear an approved uniform while on duty  under the bill.

ASSEMBLY, No. 3018 ---   
Provides explicit authorization for the Schools  Development Authority to use the design/build/operate/maintain procurement  model for school facilities projects.     ---Assemblyman WAYNE P. DEANGELO

---District 14---   
This bill would explicitly  permit the New Jersey Schools Development Authority (SDA) to use the project  delivery method known as “design/build/operate/maintain” (DBOM) to construct  public schools in this State. Under this procurement process, the SDA would  advertise and receive bids in the form of a single contract under which the  contractor would be responsible for the design and construction, as well as the  operation and maintenance of the school facilities project. If it determines  to utilize this project delivery method, the SDA would award the contract to  the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, is the  most advantageous to the SDA, price and other factors considered.   
The use of the DBOM  procurement process is designed to streamline the procurement, design,  construction, and maintenance of school facilities projects. This method of  procurement obviates the need for the SDA to deal with multiple vendors and  narrows the chain of accountability to one party – the DBOM entity. The DBOM  method also relieves the SDA districts, formerly referred to as Abbott  districts, from the burden of maintaining schools after construction is  completed.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A3500/3018_I1.HTM

---District 33---   
This bill requires the  installation of automatic fire suppression systems in elementary and secondary  schools 12,000 square feet or larger. Under the bill’s provisions, the  Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community  Affairs, is to adopt regulations necessary to implement this requirement,  including rules for the prioritization of elementary and secondary schools for  the installation of the automatic fire suppression systems. The bill provides  the State Treasurer with the authority to apply State funds otherwise available  to State departments, agencies, or instrumentalities, including the proceeds of  bonds issued by the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority for school  facilities projects under the provisions of the “Educational Facilities  Construction and Financing Act,” P.L.2000, c.72, for the purpose of securing  compliance with the bill’s requirements.

This bill authorizes the New  Jersey Economic Development Authority to issue an additional $50 million in  bonds to provide grants to support county vocational school district school facilities  projects. The bill stipulates that the additional grant funding could only be  allocated to those county vocational school district projects that increase the  capacity of the county vocational school district to serve additional students by  10% of the district’s FTE students or 75 students, whichever is greater, or to  convert part-time programs to full-time programs for at least 75 students.   
The bill also provides that in  the case of such school facilities projects that will be supported through debt  service aid, the State share of those projects as calculated under current law  will be increased by 10 percentage points.    
New Jersey’s 21 county  vocational school districts serve over 32,000 students in full-time and shared-time  programs, but demand for these programs far exceeds the space available. The  State support provided under the bill for the expansion of vocational-technical  school facilities will allow these schools to advance the academic, technical,  and career readiness of New Jersey students and provide the pipeline of skilled  workers on which the State’s economic prosperity depends.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A3500/3336_I1.HTM

Requires board of education to enter into agreement  with law enforcement authorities regarding access to live video streams of  public school buildings.     ---Assemblywoman GABRIELA M. MOSQUERA

---District 22---   
This bill requires that if a  school building of a school district is equipped with video surveillance  equipment that is capable of wirelessly streaming live video to a remote  location, the board of education must enter into a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) with local law enforcement authorities giving the authorities the ability  to activate the equipment and view live streaming videos. In the case of a  school building located in a municipality that does not have a municipal police  department, then the board would enter into the MOU with an entity designated  by the Superintendent of the State Police. The MOU would designate the  individuals who would have access to the live streaming video, the  circumstances under which the individuals would be authorized to access the  video, and a plan for preventing and detecting unauthorized access. The bill  would not require the installation of video surveillance equipment that has the  capacity to wirelessly stream video to a remote location.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A3500/3426_I1.HTM

Requires unguarded exit doors in public school  building to be equipped with alarms that detect unauthorized exit.     ---Assemblyman CARMELO G. GARCIA

---District 33---   
This bill requires that each  exit door in a public elementary or secondary school building that is unguarded  during the school day be equipped with an audible alarm that alerts school  staff of an individual exiting the building.    
Under the bill, the alarms may  be deactivated:   
(1) as determined by the school  principal during times when large groups are exiting the building such as the  beginning and end of the school day, periods of recess, fire and emergency  drills, or gatherings for outside assemblages; and    
(2) by authorized personnel of  the school who are exiting the building.    
The bill also charges each  school principal, or his designee, to promptly investigate an alarm activation  to ensure that a student has not exited the building without proper cause.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A4000/3569_I1.HTM

Requires nonpublic school buildings to be equipped  with emergency light and panic alarm linked to local law enforcement.    ---Assemblyman RALPH R. CAPUTO

---District 28---   
This bill requires that all  nonpublic elementary and secondary schools in this State be equipped with a panic  alarm for use in a school security emergency including, but not limited to, a  non-fire evacuation, lockdown, or active shooter situation. The panic alarm,  which will not be audible within the school building, must be directly linked  to law enforcement authorities and must immediately transmit a signal or  message to the authorities upon activation. The bill defines “panic alarm” as  a silent security system signal generated by the manual activation of a device  intended to signal a life-threatening or emergency situation that requires a  response from law enforcement.   
The bill also requires that  all nonpublic elementary and secondary schools be equipped with a red emergency  light that is affixed to the exterior of the school building in a highly  visible location above or near the front entrance or, if the school building is  not visible from the nearest public roadway, then on that roadway. The  emergency light must be linked to the school’s panic alarm so that it turns on  when the panic alarm is activated.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A4000/3691_I1.HTM

This bill requires that all  public and nonpublic schools be equipped with a panic alarm for use in a school  security emergency including, but not limited to, a non-fire evacuation,  lockdown, or active shooter situation. The panic alarm, which will not be  audible within the school building, must be directly linked to law enforcement  authorities and must immediately transmit a signal or message to the  authorities upon activation. The bill defines “panic alarm” as a silent  security system signal generated by the manual activation of a device intended  to signal a life-threatening or emergency situation that requires a response  from law enforcement.   
The bill also requires that  all public and nonpublic schools be equipped with a red emergency light that is  affixed to the exterior of the school building in a highly visible location  above or near the front entrance visible from the nearest public roadway or, if  the school building is not visible from the nearest public roadway, then on  that roadway. The bill requires that the emergency light be linked to the school’s  panic alarm so that it turns on when the panic alarm is activated.   
The bill directs that the  proceeds of bonds authorized to be issued to fund the State share of the costs  of Schools Development Authority district school facilities projects or the  State share of the costs of school facilities projects in all other districts,  including county vocational school districts, be used to fund the full cost of  the panic alarms and emergency lights in public school buildings.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A4000/3878_I1.HTM

Requires public utilities to provide priority service  to public schools, private schools, and public safety agencies.     ---Assemblyman CHRISTOPHER J. BROWN

---District 8---   
The bill requires a public  utility to maintain a unique customer service telephone number for public  schools, private schools, and public safety agencies to contact the public  utility, as determined by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (board).  Further, a public utility is to maintain a personnel department consisting of  technicians, customer service representatives, managerial employees, and other  employees devoted to giving priority service to public schools, private  schools, and public safety agencies, as determined by board. The term “public  utility” includes companies that are regulated by the board which provide  electric, gas, and water and sewer service. A &quot;public safety agency&quot;  is defined to mean a functional division of the State, or any political  subdivision thereof, which dispatches or provides law enforcement, fire  fighting, emergency medical services, or other emergency services.   
The bill provides that a local  exchange telecommunications company is prohibited from discontinuing service to  a public school, private school, or public safety agency that is in the process  of changing local exchange telecommunications companies until the new local exchange  telecommunications company certifies that the change has occurred and the  service is operational, as determined by the board. Under the bill, &quot;local  exchange telecommunications company&quot; is defined to mean a  telecommunications carrier regulated by the board and authorized by the board  to provide local telecommunications services.               ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A4000/3968_I1.HTM

This bill increases the  penalties for the unlawful possession of a firearm in the vicinity of  educational institutions and other public areas where people congregate.  Specifically, the bill establishes “gun free” and “weapon free” zones around  schools, day care centers, public buildings, such as libraries and museums,  public housing facilities and public parks, playgrounds and recreational  facilities.   
Under the provisions of the  bill, anyone who unlawfully possesses a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school,  college or university building or facility, or while on any school bus, is  guilty of a crime of the third degree. A crime of the third degree is  punishable by imprisonment for a term of three to five years, a fine of up to  $15,000, or both.   
Any person who possesses any  weapon within 1,000 feet of a school, college or university building or  facility, or while on a school bus, is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by imprisonment for a term of up to  18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.   
The bill also provides that  anyone who unlawfully possesses a firearm within 500 feet of a day care center,  public building, public housing facility or public park or recreational area is  guilty of a crime of the third degree. A person who unlawfully possesses any  weapon with 500 feet of any of these places or facilities is guilty of a crime  of the fourth degree.   
It is the sponsor’s intent to promote  public safety by penalizing individuals who violate the law by illegally  possessing a firearm in locations where children and families are present.               ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A4500/4277_I1.HTM

SENATE, No. 110 ---    &nbsp;    ---Senator ANTHONY R. BUCCO

---District 25---   
This bill establishes a  category of State aid for charter school facilities. Under the bill's  provisions, beginning in the 2012-2013 school year, the State will pay directly  to each charter school State facilities aid in the amount of $1800 multiplied  by the charter school's projected student enrollment. In subsequent school years,  the per pupil amount will be adjusted by the CPI. Also, for facilities aid  purposes, a charter school's projected enrollment will be adjusted based on  average daily enrollment.   
The State facilities aid for  charter schools could be used for expenses such as the rental or lease of  facilities, lease-purchase payments, renovations and repairs, maintenance, and  mortgage and utilities payments. The commissioner will define allowable  facilities aid expenditures and track the specific purposes of those expenditures.  The bill maintains the current prohibition against the use of public funds for  the construction of charter school facilities.   
The bill provides that if the  State aid for facilities received by a charter school in the budget year is not  expended during that budget year, those funds will be carried forward and  available to the charter school in subsequent budget years.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/110_I1.HTM
SENATE, No. 112 ---   
Requires the reporting of criminal offenses occurring  on school property to law enforcement authorities.     ---Senator ANTHONY R. BUCCO

---District 25---   
This bill requires the  principal or chief administrator of an elementary or secondary school who  receives information concerning the commission or suspected commission of a  criminal offense in the school or on school property to report that information  to the police department in the municipality in which the school is located or,  in the absence of a police department in the municipality, to the State Police.  The bill specifies that a &quot;criminal offense&quot; includes, but is not  limited to, any offense defined in Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes. A  person who violates the provisions of the bill will be penalized $500 for a  first offense, $1,000 for a second offense and $3,000 for a third or subsequent  offense. The municipal court where the violation occurred will have  jurisdiction over an action to recover these penalties. All penalties are  payable to the municipal clerk who is required to deposit them in the municipal  treasury. The penalties may be collected in accordance with &quot;The Penalty  Enforcement Law of 1999,&quot; P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).   
Under the bill, a principal or  responsible administrator who, in good-faith, reports criminal offense information  regarding a pupil cannot be held liable for damages in any civil suit resulting  from the reporting of this information. When a proceeding brought against a  principal or administrator under the bill's provisions is subsequently  dismissed or results in a final disposition in favor of the principal or  administrator, the principal or administrator is to be indemnified for costs  incurred in defending the proceeding, such as counsel fees and expenses  incurred in conducting the hearing or trial. A conviction under the bill may  not be deemed to be an offense involving dishonesty under N.J.S.2C:51-2, which  provides for the forfeiture of public employment if the holder of the position  is convicted of an offense involving dishonesty or a third-degree crime or  above.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/112_I1.HTM

The purpose of this bill is to  expand Megan's Law to require municipal governing bodies to be notified when a  sex offender moves into a municipality and to restrict sex offenders from  residing in areas frequented by children.   
The bill would require that  when a sex offender listed on the Internet registry maintained by the  Superintendent of the State Police registers with the chief law enforcement  officer of a municipality, the officer shall forward the name and address of  the sex offender to the governing body of the municipality. If the sex  offender must register with the Superintendent of State Police because he is  moving to a municipality that does not have a police force, then the  Superintendent of State Police shall forward the sex offender's name and  address to the governing body of the municipality in which the sex offender  intends to reside.   
The bill would also make it a  disorderly persons offense for a sex offender whose risk of re-offense has been  assessed as moderate or high to reside within 500 feet of an elementary or  secondary school, playground or child care center. The residential ban would  not cover a sex offender that resides at a prison or mental health facility  within 500 feet of an elementary or secondary school, playground or child care  center; a sex offender that continues to reside at a residence established  before the bill's enactment which is within 500 feet of an elementary or  secondary school, playground or child care center; or a sex offender that has a  school, playground or child care center established or built within 500 feet of  their existing residence. A disorderly persons offense is punishable by  imprisonment for up to six months, a fine not exceeding $1,000, or both.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/199_I1.HTM

Requires DCA to establish school security  construction code applicable to construction of new public school facilities  and school additions.     ---Senator DAWN MARIE ADDIEGO

---District 8---   
This bill requires the  Department of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Department of  Education, to establish a school security construction code, which would apply  to the construction of new public elementary and secondary school buildings and  school additions. The school security construction code must include, but need  not be limited to, minimum standards regarding: (1) the hardening of school  entrances, which may include standards regarding the composition and strength  of exterior doors and types of latching and locking hardware, and the installation  of other entrance security infrastructure; (2) the installation of locking  mechanisms on classroom doors, such as “columbine” locks which allow classroom  doors to be locked from the inside without impeding the ability of occupants to  exit; (3) minimizing the number of entrances into a school facility; and (4)  building designs that enable sections of a school to be closed off or locked  down in an emergency situation.   
The bill directs the  Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, in developing the code, to  consult with law enforcement authorities and experts in school building  security. The commissioner is also directed to examine existing State  research, data, recommendations, and standards, and any standards or  recommendations from national experts on construction and design practices that  increase school building security. The commissioner may also solicit public  input in the process.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/346_I1.HTM

This bill revises the  application process and eligibility criteria for receipt of a disability  retirement benefit under the State-administered defined benefit pension  systems, the Teachers’ Pensions and Annuity Fund (TPAF), the Judicial  Retirement System (JRS), the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS), the  Police and Firemen’s Retirement System (PFRS), and the State Police Retirement  System (SPRS). For JRS, the bill establishes an ordinary disability retirement  benefit at 1½% of final salary multiplied by years of service with a minimum of  40% of final salary, and retains for an accidental disability retirement the  current disability benefit of three-fourths of final salary.   
Under the bill, applicants for  ordinary disability and accidental disability retirement must be certified as  not only incapacitated for the performance of former duty but also for any  other available duty which the employer is willing to assign for the same  amount of compensation. For members of JRS, PFRS and SPRS, an ordinary  disability retirement would not be available until the member has 10 years of  service, instead of the current requirement of four years for PFRS and SPRS and  nominal years for JRS. Application for accidental disability retirement must  be filed within two years, instead of the current five years, of the original  traumatic event and must coincide with an application for workers’ compensation  benefits or for federal Social Security disability benefits. The results of those  applications are to be reported to the Division of Pensions and Benefits.  Currently, a retirement system may require a disability beneficiary to undergo  a medical examination for a period of 5 years following the disability retirement.  The bill provides for such an examination at the option of the system until the  beneficiary achieves a certain age.    
The bill provides that if a  JRS, PFRS or SPRS disability retiree is under normal retirement age and engaged  in an occupation, then the amount of the pension the retiree receives will be  reduced to an amount which, when added to the amount then earned, will not  exceed the amount of the salary now attributable to the retiree’s former  position. This earnings restriction already applies to TPAF and PERS  disability retirees. The bill requires the disability retirees to submit  annually to the Division of Pensions and Benefits copies of the retiree’s  federal Internal Revenue tax forms, W-2 forms, and any other proof of  employment required by regulation, unless such submission is waived by the  board of trustees of the pension fund of which the retiree is a member.   
The bill repeals the  provisions of TPAF and PERS added in 2010 that provided disability insurance  coverage, rather than a disability pension, for employees enrolled in the TPAF  or PERS on or after the effective date of P.L.2010, c.3.   
In addition, the bill requires  the Attorney General of the Department of Law and Public Safety to establish a  fraud unit for the prevention and identification of fraudulent disability  pension claims and payments, using procedures that include, but are not limited  to, the systematic review of medical examination reports of physicians for  patterns indicating possible fraud, use of a fully integrated data processing  system within the Division of Pensions and Benefits to monitor post-retirement  employment through review of the wage reporting records of the Department of  Labor, State vendor files, State payrolls, and federal Internal Revenue tax  forms, as well as a toll-free number for reports from the public. The unit  will also examine any denial of an application for workers’ compensation  benefits or for federal Social Security disability benefits, whose submission  and reported results are required of each accidental disability beneficiary, to  confirm that a beneficiary is eligible for accidental disability benefits.  Whenever the fraud unit is satisfied that a material fraud, deceit, or  intentional misrepresentation has been committed in a disability pension claim  or payment or in a purported disability pension claim or payment, or a  violation of other laws concerning pension disability fraud has occurred, it  will refer the matter to the Division of Criminal Justice.   
The bill also permits a public  employer to establish, in consultation with the appropriate officials of the  Executive Branch of State government and representatives of any relevant  collective bargaining units, an early intervention plan designed to limit  liability for accidental disability retirement benefits by ensuring the  continued employment of injured employees through medical and vocational  rehabilitation, reasonable accommodation of injured workers, and a safer  workplace.   
Finally, the bill creates a  temporary Accidental Disability Pension Review Committee. The 26-member  committee will study the current requirement that a member of TPAF, JRS, PERS,  PFRS and SPRS must be permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a  traumatic event to be deemed eligible for the receipt of an accidental  disability benefit and develop a recommendation for specific criteria detailing  what must be demonstrated by a member in order to meet the traumatic event  eligibility standard of that requirement. The committee will make only one  recommendation in the form of proposed legislation. The report containing the  recommendation will be transmitted, within 15 days after its adoption, to the  President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly, to the members  of the Legislature, to the Governor, and to the boards of trustees of the TPAF,  PERS, PFRS, and SPRS and the State House Commission, which oversees JRS.   
Within 90 days after receipt  of the report, the Legislature must vote on legislation based on the  recommendation of the committee. If both Houses of the Legislature do not pass  legislation within 90 days, or if both Houses do pass legislation but the  Governor does not sign it within 30 days after passage by both Houses, each of  the boards of trustees and commission will meet to discuss the recommendation  in the report. A vote will be taken at that meeting to adopt or reject the  recommendation in its entirety without modification. If a majority of the membership  votes in the affirmative, the criteria will be deemed adopted and will be implemented  by the board or commission for all applicants who submit applications 30 days  after the date of adoption. If a majority of the membership votes to reject  the recommendation, the criteria for all applicants will not be changed. If  the recommendation is rejected, the board or commission will meet again within  the following 12-month period to discuss the recommendation and will take  another vote to adopt or reject the recommendation. The boards or commission  cannot rescind the adoption of the recommendation and neither the committees of  TPAF, PERS, PFRS and SPRS nor the commission can change the adopted criteria.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/76_I1.HTM

Replaces TPAF, PERS, PFRS and SPRS accidental  disability benefits with reduced work-related disability benefit; modifies JRS  disability benefit.     ---Senator JOSEPH PENNACCHIO

---District 26---   
This bill replaces the  accidental disability benefit available to members of the Teachers’ Pension and  Annuity Fund (TPAF), the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS), the Police  and Firemen’s Retirement System (PFRS) and the State Police Retirement System  (SPRS) with a new work-related disability benefit that is the same as the TPAF,  PERS, PFRS and SPRS ordinary disability benefit of 1½% of compensation for each  year of service but no less than 40% of compensation. The bill also (1)  reduces the percentage applied to compensation to 1½% from 1.64% for TPAF and  PERS to parallel to the benefits of PFRS and SPRS; (2) increases to ten from  four the years of service credit required before a PFRS or SPRS member becomes  eligible for ordinary disability retirement to parallel the requirements of  TPAF and PERS; (3) repeals sections of P.L. 2010, c. 3 providing that new TPAF  and PERS members would be eligible for disability insurance instead of a  disability pension; and (4) repeals the accidental disability allowance  sections of law for TPAF, PERS, PFRS and SPRS.   
Under the bill, any TPAF,  PERS, PFRS or SPRS member under normal retirement age who has fewer than 10  years of creditable service may be retired on a work-related disability  retirement allowance, if the member meets the requirements of a medical  examination certifying that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated  for the performance of usual duty and of any other available duty, and the  incapacity from the performance of duties is the direct result of an accident  or occupational exposure occurring during and as a result of regular and  assigned duties and not the result of willful negligence. In order to qualify  for a work-related disability benefit, the member must receive a workers’  compensation award of permanent disability. The requirement for a medical  examination may be waived when the Division of Workers’ Compensation in the  Department of Labor and Workforce Development has determined that the member is  100% totally and permanently disabled. The bill defines “normal retirement  age” for these systems as the age at which a member is first eligible for a  service retirement benefit.   
The bill allows SPRS to  require any disability retiree who is under normal retirement age to undergo a  medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the system for a  period of five years following retirement in order to determine whether or not  the disability has vanished or has materially diminished. TPAF, PERS and PFRS  members are already subject to this requirement. In addition, the bill  provides that if the PFRS or SPRS disability retiree is under normal retirement  age and engaged in an occupation, then the amount of the disability pension  will be reduced to an amount which when added to the amount then earned will  not exceed the amount of the salary now attributable to the retiree’s former  position. TPAF and PERS disability retirees are already subject to such a  reduction. A work-related disability benefit will be reduced by the amount of  workers’ compensation benefits in the same manner as currently provided with  regard to an accidental disability benefit.   
The bill also modifies the law  governing the Judicial Retirement System to provide disability retirement  benefits in an amount comparable to other State employees. Under current law,  a judge of the several courts may be retired for disability if the member has  become physically or otherwise incapacitated for full and efficient service to  the State in his judicial capacity. The bill changes the amount of the  disability retirement benefit from 75% of final salary to 1½% of salary  multiplied by his number of years of aggregate service as a judge, or in office,  position, or employment of this State or of a county, municipality, board of  education or public agency of this State; and further provides, that in no  event shall the allowance be less than 40% of final salary. If the disability  beneficiary is engaged in an occupation, then the amount of his pension shall  be reduced to an amount which when added to the amount then earned by him,  shall not exceed the amount of the salary now attributable to his former  position. If his earnings have changed since the date of his last adjustment,  then the amount of his pension may be further altered, but the new pension  shall not exceed the amount of pension originally granted.   
The bill also provides that  the pension committees established pursuant to sections 1 through 5 of  P.L.2011, c.78, shall not modify the amount of a work-related disability  retirement established under this act.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S0500/418_I1.HTM

SENATE, No. 1588 ---   
Reinstates automatic COLA for retirement benefits of  members of the State-administered retirement systems.     ---Senator SHIRLEY K. TURNER

---District 15---   
This bill reinstates automatic  cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for retirement benefits under the “Pension  Adjustment Act,” P.L.1958, c.143 (C.43:3B-1 et seq.), for members of the  Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund, the Judicial Retirement System, the Public  Employees’ Retirement System, the Police and Firemen’s Retirement System, and  the State Police Retirement System. Provisions contained in P.L.2011, c.78  (C.43:3C-16 et al), signed into law on June 28, 2011, cancelled the automatic, annual adjustment for current and future retirees and beneficiaries of these  State-administered retirement systems.   
COLAs protect retirement  benefits against erosion by inflation, the ills of which were addressed by the  Legislature, both for the individual and the State, with the enactment of the  “Pension Adjustment Act” in 1958.    
Without the annual adjustment,  retirees and beneficiaries will gradually see significant reductions in their  purchasing power. The loss of COLAs will impact their everyday lives, and,  over time, make it harder to afford more necessary elements of living, such as  out-of-pocket medical costs, groceries, and utility bills. Retirees and  beneficiaries will find it more prudent, or perhaps necessary, to leave this  State for other states with a comparably lower cost of living.   
For the State, such outbound  migration will result in the loss of the economic activity of those retirees  and beneficiaries, and any tax revenues concomitant with such activity. In  addition, New Jersey’s fiscal outlook may be further strained by the retirees  and beneficiaries who remain. These persons will continue to slip further downward  on the socioeconomic scale. In some cases, they will require, or at the least  become eligible and utilize, greater levels of public assistance under the many  taxpayer funded social programs administered by the State, counties, and  municipalities, requiring more revenues to meet this increased demand.   
In the interests of the  retirees and beneficiaries of the State-administered retirement systems, and  the State, this bill reinstates the automatic COLAs for retirement benefits  under the “Pension Adjustment Act.”              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S2000/1588_I1.HTM
SENATE, No. 1805 ---   
Allows individual appointed as State monitor to  remain employed for more than two years without cancellation of retirement  benefits.     ---Senator JENNIFER BECK

---District 35---   
Under current law, if an  individual is receiving a retirement allowance from the Teachers’ Pension and  Annuity Fund (TPAF), and the individual becomes employed in a position covered  by TPAF, then the individual would cease to receive a pension allowance and  would resume making payments to the pension system. The law provides for two  exceptions to this provision: 1) someone employed by the Department of  Education in a position of critical needs, and 2) a superintendent or  administrator employed by a school district on a contractual basis. In the  latter case, the term of the contract may not be for more than one year, and  may be renewed for one additional year.   
A State monitor appointed by  the Commissioner of Education to oversee a school district is considered, for  most purposes, to be an employee of the school district; as such, an individual  who has retired would be subject to the two-year restriction. This bill  creates a distinction between a State monitor and other individuals employed by  a school district, thereby exempting the State monitors from the two-year  limitation.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S2000/1805_I1.HTM
SENATE, No. 1949 ---   
Provides exceptions to garnish exemption against  benefits from State-administered pension systems for certain financial claims  under State law.     ---Senator KEVIN J. O'TOOLE

---District 40---   
Currently, the retirement  benefits of a member or beneficiary of the Teachers’ Pension and Annuity Fund,  the Judicial Retirement System, the Public Employees Retirement System, the  Police and Firemen’s Retirement System, and the State Police Retirement System  are generally exempt from any State or municipal tax and from levy and sale,  garnishment, attachment or any other process arising out of any State or  Federal court and are unassignable.   
Under this bill, the right to  the retirement benefits remains so exempt except to (1) satisfy a certificate  of debt issued by the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation pursuant  to subsection (c) of N.J.S.A.54A:9-12; (2) satisfy a debt owed to the Victims  of Crime Compensation Agency for the portion of an assessment ordered pursuant  to N.J.S.A.2C:43-3.1 for deposit in the Victims of Crime Compensation Agency  account or restitution ordered to be paid to the board pursuant to N.J.S.A.2C:44-2  for deposit in the Victims of Crime Compensation Agency Account; (3) satisfy a  court order for child support, alimony or equitable distribution, including but  not limited to a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section  414(p) of the federal Internal Revenue Code; or (4) satisfy an Internal Revenue  Service levy or federal criminal restitution order. Regulations promulgated by  the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the  Treasury will provide for (1) due notice to the recipient of the pension,  annuity or retirement allowance and procedures to contest the setoff prior to  any setoff being imposed, and (2) safeguards against the disclosure or  inappropriate use of any personally identifiable information regarding the  recipient.   
The bill also allows no  exemption for claims by the State of New Jersey against the retirement  allowances or return of pension contributions payable to a member or  beneficiary of any State-administered retirement system with regard to property  held in a qualifying trust and any distributions from a qualifying trust  currently exempt from all claims of creditors under N.J.S.A.25:2-1.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S2000/1949_I1.HTM
SENATE, No. 2005 ---   
Permits institutions of higher education to make  supplemental contributions to ABP.     ---Senator LINDA R. GREENSTEIN

---District 14---   
This bill authorizes a public  institution of higher education to make a supplemental contribution to the  Alternate Benefit Program on behalf of its faculty members. An election by a  public institution of higher education to make such a supplemental contribution  must be irrevocable. Under the bill, the supplemental contribution may include  an amount that results in a total contribution that exceeds the rate of 8% of  the maximum salary for department officers, which is currently $141,000, but  does not exceed the rate equal to 8% of the faculty member’s base salary.  Currently, the State is required to make the 8% employer contribution for  Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the State and  county colleges.              ---http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S2500/2005_I1.HTM

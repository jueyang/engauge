# Lawlert

Democritizing law-making.

This is a prototype developed for [Hack NJ 2.0](http://www.hackjersey.com/)

# Description

Law-lert gives activists, journalists, and concerned citizens a simple way to track and vote on legislation being introduced in their state. Users select categories to follow (public safety, transportation, housing, etc.) and receive short tweetable updates when bills are introduced, sent to committee, or sent to the governor.
